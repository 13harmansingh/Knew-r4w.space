      <h2>The Future of Verified Reality</h2>
      <p>
        In an age where truth can be edited, filtered, or manufactured, <strong>KNEW</strong> was built to restore trust in what’s real.
        It began as a vision — a living network where human knowledge, emotion, and events could exist transparently, verified by time and place.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, that vision has evolved into <strong>KNEW v2</strong> — an enterprise trust infrastructure that verifies media, events, and data at the source.
        KNEW empowers organizations, journalists, and citizens to confirm what truly happened in the world.

      <h2>Two Realities, One Vision</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>KNEW v2</strong> transformed creative human expression into structure — an intelligent trust system that verifies reality itself.
        It’s where creativity meets truth, emotion meets data, and human experience becomes reliable.

      <h2>The Future</h2>
      <p>
        The world doesn’t need more content — it needs verified reality.  
        KNEW is building the foundation for that.
        Every verified moment strengthens the network. Every truth brings us closer to understanding ourselves.
