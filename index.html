    <h1>🦋 About KNEW</h1>
    <h2>The Future of Verified Reality</h2>

    <p>In an age where truth can be edited, filtered, or manufactured, KNEW was built to restore trust in what’s real. It began as a vision — a living network where human knowledge, emotion, and events could exist transparently, verified by time and place.</p>

    <p>Today, that vision has evolved into KNEW v2 — the verification layer for human reality. It’s an enterprise trust system that verifies media, events, and data at the source — giving organizations, journalists, and citizens a way to confirm what truly happened in the world.</p>

    <p>KNEW doesn’t just collect information. It captures proof — with context, emotion, and credibility woven into every signal. From a simple photo to a major event, KNEW ensures that truth becomes measurable.</p>

    <p>Our mission is simple yet ambitious: To rebuild trust in human reality, one verified moment at a time.</p>

    <h2>Two Realities, One Vision</h2>

    <p><strong>KNEW v2 — The System</strong><br />KNEW v2 transformed that creative spark into structure — an intelligent trust infrastructure that verifies reality itself. It’s where creativity meets truth, emotion meets data, and human experience becomes reliable.</p>

    <h2>The Future</h2>

    <p>The world no longer needs more content — it needs verified reality. KNEW is building the foundation for that. Every verified moment strengthens the network. Every truth makes us closer to understanding ourselves.</p>
